## Haiii! I am mldkyt!

I like programming and I am a expert at it. I code in many languages, such as C#, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go and many others that I forgot to list.

I have a [website with my projects](https://mldkyt.com/).

I am on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@programmer.astolfo), [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@mldkyt), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/programmerastolfo) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/MLDKYT) [(Subreddit)](https://reddit.com/r/mldkyt).
